# Competitive-Programming-Tools
This is my collection of pre-written code designed to be used for competitive programming in Java. Some advantages of using Java (as opposed to C++) is the built in BigInteger class and java.awt.geom for computational geometry.

Due to these specific cases where Java has objective advantages over C++, a substantial array of competitive programming tools can be found here that should suffice on its own for the majority of competitions.
